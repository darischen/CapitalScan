# TESTS.md

Test strategy and inventory for `CapitalScan`.

## 1. What actually needs testing

Coverage is allocated by **how silently a failure would propagate**, not uniformly (ADR 085).

| Area | Risk | Coverage |
|---|---|---|
| `core/signals.py`, `core/exits.py` | Silent bias — wrong results that look plausible | Exhaustive |
| Data validation and ingest | Corrupt input producing confident output | High |
| Statistics layer | Correct code answering the wrong question | High |
| API routes, UI, CLI | Visible breakage, cheap to catch manually | Smoke only |

The distinguishing property: a bug in `exits.py` produces a number that looks fine and is wrong, and could persist for months. A bug in the screener produces a blank screen noticed immediately.

**Coverage gate: 90% on `core/` only.** No repo-wide target — that pushes toward meaningless tests for CLI argument parsing.

---

## 2. Tiers

```
tests/
  unit/          pure functions, in-memory fixtures, <1 s total
  property/      hypothesis-generated invariants
  golden/        known-answer cases, hand-verified against charts
  integration/   real Postgres via testcontainers, small ticker set
  acceptance/    phase gates, run manually
```

Tooling: `pytest`, `pytest-xdist` for parallelism, `hypothesis` for property tests, `testcontainers[postgres]` for integration.

---

## 3. The five correctness tests

Each catches a failure that would otherwise ship silently. These carry the correctness load for the entire project.

### 3.1 Look-ahead detection

```python
def test_shift_changes_events(bars, indicators):
    base    = detect_all(bars, indicators)
    shifted = detect_all(bars, indicators.shift(1))
    assert jaccard(base, shifted) < 0.5
```

If shifting indicators forward a day barely changes the event set, either the signal is not reading the indicators or it is already using future data and the shift is a no-op.

Applies to both `core/signals.py` and the `events` job, since the t−1 guard exists at both layers (DESIGN §3.6, §4.7).

### 3.2 Signal path parity — ADR 006 enforcement

```python
def test_backtest_and_live_agree(fixture_bar, fixture_ind, fixture_bands):
    bt = detect(fixture_bar, fixture_ind, SP)
    live = []
    for tick in simulate_intraday(fixture_bar):   # open → low → high → close
        live += breach_live(tick, fixture_bands, SP)
    assert {s.signal_type for s in bt} == set(dedupe(live))
```

The simulated path walks open → low → high → close, which is the ordering assumption the backtest makes.

This is the test that prevents the live system from firing on events the backtest never measured.

### 3.3 Determinism — ADR 060

```python
def test_identical_config_identical_output(bars, indicators, universe):
    a = backtest(CFG, bars, indicators, universe)
    b = backtest(CFG, bars, indicators, universe)
    assert_frame_equal(a.drop(columns=["run_id"]),
                       b.drop(columns=["run_id"]))
```

Run with test-ordering randomization **enabled** so hidden global state surfaces.

### 3.4 Exit resolver invariants — property-based

```python
@given(entry=prices(),
       bars=ohlc_sequences(min_size=5, max_size=5),
       cfg=exit_configs())
def test_exit_invariants(entry, bars, ind, atr, cfg):
    r = resolve_exit(entry, 0, Side.LONG, bars, ind, atr, cfg)

    assert bars.low[r.exit_idx] <= r.exit_price <= bars.high[r.exit_idx]
    assert 1 <= r.holding_days <= cfg.max_hold_days
    assert r.mae <= 0 <= r.mfe
    assert r.mfe >= realized_return(entry, r.exit_price, Side.LONG)

    if r.reason == ExitReason.STOP:
        assert r.exit_price <= entry * (1 - min_stop_distance(cfg))
```

**The MFE invariant is the sharp one.** Realized return can never exceed max favorable excursion. Any violation means the path metrics and the exit disagree about what happened.

Target: 10,000 generated cases.

### 3.5 Split leakage — structural

```python
def test_no_split_leakage(events):
    assert events[events.split_key == "train"].signal_date.max() <= TRAIN_END
    assert events[events.split_key == "holdout"].signal_date.min() > VALIDATE_END

    for fold in purged_folds:
        assert not overlaps(fold.train_windows, fold.validate_start)
```

`split_key` is assigned at event creation, never computed at query time (ADR 019), which makes leakage a schema violation rather than a discipline problem.

### 3.6 Holdout firewall — ADR 088

```python
def test_serving_views_never_read_holdout(db):
    for view in SERVING_VIEWS_WITH_STATS:
        ddl = get_view_definition(db, view)
        assert "'validate'" in ddl, f"{view} must pin split_key"
        assert "e.split_key" not in ddl, f"{view} must not inherit event split"

def test_screener_shows_no_holdout_stats(db):
    rows = query(db, "SELECT * FROM v_screen WHERE p_hit IS NOT NULL")
    ids  = [r.cell_id for r in rows]
    splits = query(db, "SELECT DISTINCT split_key FROM cell_stats WHERE cell_id = ANY(%s)", (ids,))
    assert set(splits) <= {"validate"}
```

A live event carries `split_key = 'holdout'` by date assignment. Without this guard, a join inheriting it would surface holdout statistics continuously and the numbers would look entirely reasonable.

## 4. Golden fixtures

Hand-verified cases committed as CSV, each with a comment explaining what it tests.

| Fixture | Content | Verifies |
|---|---|---|
| `tsm_2026_07.csv` | TSM, 60 bars around the July 28-30 move | A real observed event, end to end |
| `nvda_split_2024.csv` | NVDA 10-for-1 split window | Split adjustment does not fabricate a breach |
| `meta_2022_crash.csv` | Meta's 2022 decline | Repeated lower-band touches in a deep drawdown |
| `intc_2021_2024.csv` | Intel's slow decline | Health filter drops it, and exactly when |
| `flat_series.csv` | Constant price | Stochastic division by zero returns NaN, not 50 |
| `gap_down.csv` | 12% overnight gap through a stop | Gap fill rules (DESIGN §5.5) |
| `ambiguous_bar.csv` | Low hits stop, high hits target, same bar | Stop wins, `ambiguous` set |
| `external_reference.csv` | 5 dates × 2 tickers | Indicator math matches external convention |

### 4.1 External reference — ADR 086

```bash
cscan verify-indicators --ticker TSM --ticker NVDA --dates 2026-07-29,...
```

Prints computed `bb_upper`, `bb_mid`, `bb_lower`, `k_full`, `d_full` and writes `tests/golden/external_reference.csv` with empty `external_*` columns. The user fills them once by hand from StockCharts or TradingView (~30 minutes). A test asserts agreement within 0.1%.

**Why this matters:** the formulas in ADR 004 are standard, but ddof choice and the middle-band SMA-vs-EMA question are exactly where implementations silently diverge, and every downstream number inherits the error. Thirty minutes against a class of error that would stay invisible for months.

---

## 5. Data validation tests

Every rule in DESIGN §2.3 gets a test with a crafted violating row. Additionally:

```python
def test_no_nulls_after_warmup(indicators):
    post = indicators[indicators.ts >= "2010-01-01"]
    for col in REQUIRED_INDICATOR_COLS:
        assert post[col].isna().sum() == 0        # ADR 040
```

```python
def test_stooq_agreement(sample_tickers):          # integration tier
    diff = compare_closes(yf_data, stooq_data)
    assert (diff.abs() > 0.005).mean() < 0.01
```

```python
def test_ingest_idempotent(db, ticker):
    run_ingest(ticker); n1 = row_count(db, "bars")
    run_ingest(ticker); n2 = row_count(db, "bars")
    assert n1 == n2
```

```python
def test_indicator_read_window_expands():
    """Writing 5 days must read ~400 calendar days (max_warmup × 1.6)."""
    read_start, write_start = plan_indicator_window(date(2026, 7, 25), date(2026, 7, 30))
    assert (write_start - read_start).days >= ceil(max_warmup() * 1.6)
```

---

## 6. Statistical verification

Two tests catching a category no unit test can (ADR 087).

### 6.1 Null strategy produces null edge — the highest-value test in the suite

```python
def test_random_walk_has_no_edge():
    synthetic = gbm(n_tickers=50, days=2500, mu=0, sigma=0.02, seed=42)
    events = backtest(CFG, synthetic, compute_all(synthetic), universe_all)
    stats  = compute_cells(events)
    assert (stats.q_value < 0.05).mean() <= 0.05
```

If a random walk produces significant cells, the statistics layer has a bug and **every real result is suspect.** This validates the reasoning rather than the code.

### 6.2 Known drift is recovered

```python
def test_baseline_recovers_known_drift():
    synthetic = gbm(mu=0.20, sigma=0.30, seed=7)
    base = compute_baseline(synthetic, target=0.02, horizon=5)
    expected = 1 - norm.cdf((0.02 - 0.20/50.4) / (0.30 * sqrt(5/252)))
    assert abs(base.parametric - expected) < 0.01
```

---

## 7. Model tests (Phase 6)

```python
def test_quantiles_monotone(model, features):
    q = model.predict_quantiles(features)
    assert (np.diff(q, axis=1) >= 0).all()

def test_calibration_beats_cell_lookup(model, validation):
    assert brier(model.predict(validation)) < brier(cell_lookup(validation))

def test_no_future_features(feature_frame, event_dates):
    """Every feature value must be derivable from data at t−1."""
    for col in FEATURE_COLS:
        assert not depends_on_future(col, feature_frame, event_dates)

def test_promotion_gate_rejects_flattened_model():
    """A model predicting the base rate everywhere gains ECE but must fail."""
    flat = ConstantModel(base_rate)
    assert not passes_promotion_gate(flat, incumbent, validation)
```

The last one guards the degenerate win described in ADR 067.

---

## 8. Tool and chat tests (Phase 5)

```python
def test_every_tool_returns_valid_schema(tool_name, sample_args):
    result = call_tool(tool_name, sample_args)
    assert TOOL_SCHEMAS[tool_name].model_validate(result)

def test_validator_rejects_naked_probability():
    resp = "There's a 51% chance of a rebound."
    assert not validate_response(resp, tool_calls=[...]).ok

def test_validator_allows_sourced_advisory():
    resp = ("TSM fired confluence-low. That cell resolved up 3% within "
            "5 sessions in 51% of 340 effective cases, CI 46-56.")
    assert validate_response(resp, tool_calls=[...]).ok

def test_suppressed_cell_never_yields_a_number():
    result = get_stats(signal_type="confluence_low", ticker="RARE")
    assert result.suppressed and result.p_hit is None
```

---

## 9. CI configuration

```yaml
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  fast:
    - ruff check
    - ruff format --check
    - mypy core/
    - pytest tests/unit tests/property
  slow:
    services: [postgres]
    - pytest tests/golden tests/integration
```

Fast tier under 60 seconds. Slow tier under 5 minutes. **Acceptance tests never run in CI** — they need the real database and the full dataset.

---

## 10. Phase acceptance gates

Each gate is a command producing a pass or fail.

### Phase 1

```bash
cscan scan --ticker TSM --start 2026-07-01 --end 2026-07-30
```

- Returns the 2026-07-29 event with correct %B and %K
- All golden fixtures pass
- Zero nulls in indicators after 2010-01-01
- Stooq agreement within tolerance
- Random-walk null test passes

### Phase 2

- Poller detects a live breach within one polling interval
- Notification delivered on all three configured channels
- `poller_sessions` records the session with coverage percentage
- Restart mid-session does not re-fire an already-sent event

### Phase 3

- Exit invariants hold across 10,000 property-generated cases
- Ambiguity rate below 10%, or hourly escalation implemented
- Event count within 20% of the analytical estimate (~4% of ticker-days for confluence)
- Determinism test passes
- All five validation-harness checks pass (DESIGN §5.10)

### Phase 4

- Three-arm comparison produces a chart
- Random-entry null spans 200 replications
- Every headline cell reports `n_eff`, CI, baseline, and q-value
- Drawdown slice renders
- Random-walk null test passes on the full pipeline

### Phase 5

- Every tool returns a schema-valid response
- Validator rejects a crafted naked-probability response
- Validator allows a sourced advisory response
- MCP server responds to `tools/list` and one live `tools/call`

### Phase 6

- Model beats cell-lookup Brier score on validation, or lookup ships alone
- Reliability diagram renders
- Forward log accumulates predictions and resolves them at T+6
- Promotion gate rejects a deliberately flattened model
